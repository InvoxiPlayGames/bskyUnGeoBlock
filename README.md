# bskyUnGeoBlock

A very basic web browser extension for disabling geo-block moderation and age
verification on Bluesky's web app.

## Installation

The extension isn't currently available on any web store, it must be installed
manually.

### Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Vivaldi, etc (Chromiums)

1. Download the extension's ZIP file from [the releases page](https://github.com/InvoxiPlayGames/bskyUnGeoBlock/releases).
2. Extract the ZIP file somewhere on your computer.
3. Open your browser's "Extensions" page.
4. Enable the "Developer mode" toggle.
5. Click the new "Load unpacked" button
6. Select the folder you extracted the ZIP file to in stage 2.

### Mozilla Firefox

Firefox doesn't allow installation of extensions that aren't approved by Mozilla.
I'm working on getting the extension approved, but you can use
[mary's uBlock Origin rules](https://gist.github.com/mary-ext/6e27b24a83838202908808ad528b3318)
instead.

**To install it temporarily (will be uninstalled after closing Firefox):**

1. Download the extension's ZIP file from [the releases page](https://github.com/InvoxiPlayGames/bskyUnGeoBlock/releases).
2. Go to `about:debugging` in Firefox and select "This Firefox" on the sidebar.
3. Click "Load Temporary Add-on..."
4. Select the ZIP you downloaded in stage 1.

### Apple Safari

The extension does not support Safari.
